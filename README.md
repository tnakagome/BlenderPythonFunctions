# Python Utility Functions for Blender

A collection of python utility functions for Blender.
Some of them are based on information from the Internet while others are scooped from the "Info" panel in Blender.

A subdirectory indicates Blender's version number that the scripts are meant for, since Blender's Python API may change over time.

Feel free to copy and paste the codes into your scripts.
